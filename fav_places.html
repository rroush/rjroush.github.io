        <h3>London, England</h3>
        <img class="img2" src="https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/0e/62/62/df/london.jpg" alt="City of London">
        <p> The city of London is the capital of England. It is located on the River Thames. My favorite feature of the city is the variety of museums. Near London is the Natural History Museum, the Museum of London, the British Museum, the Churchill War Rooms, and the Victoria and Albert Museum just to name a few. The city also has many fantastic dining options that can easily be reached by the public transit system.</p>

        <p> Florida is home to many beautiful places to get into the water, but Seven Sisters Springs is my absolute favorite. These springs are a natural inland waterway that branch off the Chassahowitzka River. It is a manatee and otter gathering place. At this location, visitors can kayak or paddle board the river as well as snorkel at The Crack, and underwater cliff edge.</p>
